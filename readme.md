# Installation

The easiest way to use the workflow is as a python package. To set this up:

1. Create a conda environment
    - install miniconda as described here:
      https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/linux.html
    - using mamba is recommended, to install it: `conda install mamba`
    - then create the workflow environment: `mamba env create -f /path/to/smk_wgbs/smk_wgbs_dev_env.yaml`
2. There is no pypi/conda package yet (coming soon). To install the package
    - clone the repository
    - run `pip install /path/to/smk_wgbs`
